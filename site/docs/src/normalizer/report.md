# `normalizer report`

## Reports

The `report` command generates reports about initial and normalized `PHI` programs.

The reports contain detailed information about metrics collected for these programs.

The reports are in `HTML`, `GitHub Flavored Markdown`, and `JSON` formats.

## Environment

The command requires that there are:

- Initial `PHI` programs
- Normalized `PHI` programs
- A report configuration file

### `PHI` programs

Currently, we translate `EO` programs and get initial `PHI` programs.

Next, we normalize these `PHI` programs and get normalized `PHI` programs.

### Report configuration file

The report configuration file has several attributes:

- `input`
  - `js` - Optional path to a `JavaScript` file that should be inlined into an `HTML` report.
    - If no path is specified, `normalizer` will use `report/main.js` from the `eo-phi-normalizer` package.
  - `css` - Optional path to a `CSS` file that should be inlined into an `HTML` report.
    - If no path is specified, `normalizer` will use `report/styles.css` from the `eo-phi-normalizer` package.
- `output`
  - `html` - Optional path to an `HTML` report.
    - If no path is specified, the `HTML` report won't be generated.
  - `json` - Optional path to a `JSON` report.
    - If no path is specified, the `JSON` report won't be generated.
  - `markdown` - Optional path to a `GitHub Flavored Markdown` report.
    - If no path is specified, the `GitHub Flavored Markdown` report won't be generated.
- `expected-metrics-change` - Specifies expected changes of metrics for normalized `PHI` programs relative to the initial `PHI` programs. Values represent `(metric_initial - metric_normalized) / metric_ initial`. Attributes:
  - `dataless`
  - `applications`
  - `formations`
  - `dispatches`
- `items`
  - `phi` - path to an initial `PHI` program.
  - `phi-normalized` - path to a normalized `PHI` program.
    - The normalized `PHI` program should correspond to the initial `PHI` program.
  - `bindings-path-phi` - path to bindings of a formation in the initial `PHI` program.
    - `org.eolang` corresponds to a formation `Φ.org.eolang`.
  - `bindings-path-phi-normalized` - path to bindings of a formation in the normalized `PHI` program.
    - `org.eolang` corresponds to a formation `Φ.org.eolang`.

#### Sample report configuration file

The `normalizer` repository contains the `report/config.yaml` report configuration file.

## CLI

### `--help`

```$ as console
normalizer report --help
```

```console
Usage: normalizer report (-c|--config FILE)

  Generate reports about initial and normalized PHI programs.

Available options:
  -c,--config FILE         The FILE with a report configuration.
  -h,--help                Show this help text
```

### `--config`

Generate reports using a configuration file `report/config.yaml`.

```$ as console
normalizer report --config report/config.yaml
ls report/report*
```

```console
report/report.html
report/report.json
report/report.md
```
